# Disclaimer
This is in a early stage, have bugs and **IT'S NOT FINISHED**

This is my first python srcipt, so expect the code to be messy and not perfect
# What is this
This is a Script made with Python that play sounds when you gain or lose health using OCR

To make others hear the sounds use a program like [Virtual Audio Cable](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/) to make a virtual microphone that stream the PC Audio, with that other will hear all the sounds throught the voice chat (**DONT USE THIS TO BOTHER OTHER PLAYERS**)
# Requirements
You need Python, I recomend using the 3.6 version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), and this libraries:
```
pyscreenshot
pytesseract
Pillow
pygame
time
```
# How To Use It
When finish intalling all the libraries navigate using the Command Prompt to the folder where you have the script and type:
```
python main.py
```
# Modifications
You can change the audio that plays when you lose or gain health. Just replace the audios whit the ones you want.

**DONT CHANGE THE FOLDER OR NAME OF THE AUDIOS OR THEY WONT PLAY AND WILL CAUSE AN ERROR**
```
nice.mp3 plays when you gain healt

pium.mp3 plays when you lose health
```
